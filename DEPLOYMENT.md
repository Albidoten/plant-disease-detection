# üöÄ Deployment Guide - YOLO Object Detection Web App

This guide will help you deploy your YOLO web application to various online platforms.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Git installed** on your computer
2. **GitHub account** (free)
3. **Hosting platform account** (choose one):
   - Render (recommended - free tier available)
   - Railway (free tier available)
   - Heroku (paid)
   - PythonAnywhere (free tier available)

## üîß Step 1: Upload to GitHub

### Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `yolo-object-detection`
4. Make it **Public** (required for free hosting)
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Upload Files
1. **Upload all files** from the `yolo-web-app-github` folder to your new repository
2. Make sure to include:
   - `app.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `templates/index.html`
   - `Procfile`
   - `runtime.txt`
   - `.gitignore`
   - `README.md`
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## üåê Step 2: Deploy to Hosting Platform

### Option A: Render (Recommended - Free)

1. **Sign up** at [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **Connect GitHub** account
3. **Create New Web Service**
4. **Select your repository**: `yolo-object-detection`
5. **Configure settings**:
   - **Name**: `yolo-object-detection`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python app.py`
   - **Instance Type**: `Free`
6. **Deploy**

### Option B: Railway (Alternative - Free)

1. **Sign up** at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **New Project** ‚Üí **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. **Select your repository**
4. **Configure**:
   - Railway will auto-detect Python
   - No additional configuration needed
5. **Deploy**

### Option C: PythonAnywhere (Alternative - Free)

1. **Sign up** at [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)
2. **Upload files** via Files tab
3. **Create Web App**:
   - Python 3.12
   - Flask framework
   - Point to your `app.py`
4. **Install packages** in Bash console:
   ```bash
   pip3.12 install --user -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables (if needed)

Some platforms may require environment variables:
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (automatically set by most platforms)

## üìù Important Notes

### Model Download
- The YOLOv8 model (6.25MB) will be downloaded automatically on first run
- This may take a few minutes during initial deployment
- Subsequent starts will be faster

### File Storage
- Uploaded images are stored temporarily
- On free hosting, files may be deleted after inactivity
- For production, consider using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)

### Performance
- Free hosting tiers have limitations:
  - CPU/Memory constraints
  - Cold starts (app sleeps when inactive)
  - Processing time limits
- For heavy usage, consider paid tiers

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Timeout**
   - Increase build timeout in platform settings
   - YOLOv8 installation can take time

2. **Memory Issues**
   - Use YOLOv8n (nano) model for lower memory usage
   - Consider upgrading to paid tier

3. **Port Issues**
   - App automatically uses PORT environment variable
   - No manual configuration needed

4. **Model Loading Errors**
   - Ensure internet connectivity for model download
   - Check platform logs for specific errors

## üìä Monitoring

After deployment:
1. **Check logs** for any errors
2. **Test image upload** functionality
3. **Monitor performance** and response times
4. **Set up health checks** if available

## üîÑ Updates

To update your deployed app:
1. Make changes to your files
2. Upload updated files to GitHub
3. Most platforms will automatically redeploy

## üí° Tips for Production

1. **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
2. **Add error handling** for failed uploads
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
4. **Add user authentication** if needed
5. **Use CDN** for static files
6. **Monitor usage** and costs

## üéØ Next Steps

After successful deployment:
- Share your live URL with others
- Add custom domain (if supported)
- Monitor usage and performance
- Consider adding new features
- Scale up if needed

Your YOLO web application will be accessible worldwide once deployed! üåç
